# TESTING TIME SPENT OF EACH REQUEST

---

After cloning this project, you must run command `npm install` or `yarn` to install required packages.

Than, you'll need to get a valid token to access Bari's system.

When you get your token you'll need to crete you own `.env` file, as the `.env.example`, and put the token within, but only the token, without Bearer prefix.

After doing this you can run the 50 requests and get a consoled result by running `yarn start` or `npm start`.
